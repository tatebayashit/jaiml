# JAIML Project Bibliography Comprehensive Verification Report  

The systematic verification of 29 references reveals **significant bibliographic errors** that require immediate correction, with 6 references containing major inaccuracies and one entirely non-existent citation. While most classical and recent NLP references are accurate, the Japanese language sources contain systematic errors that undermine the bibliography's scholarly integrity.

## Critical findings and corrections needed

**Five references require immediate correction** to maintain academic standards. The Japanese language sources show particularly severe issues, with wrong authors, incorrect publication years, and title discrepancies that suggest incomplete verification during initial compilation.

### References requiring immediate correction

**[12] 井上逸兵 reference - Publication year error**
- **Listed:** 井上逸兵 (2006). 『伝わるしくみと異文化間コミュニケーション』. 南雲堂
- **Correct:** 井上逸兵 (1999). 『伝わるしくみと異文化間コミュニケーション』. 南雲堂
- **Issue:** Seven-year publication date discrepancy
- **Verification:** ISBN 9784523263395, 235 pages, published May 20, 1999

**[13] 伊藤たかね reference - Title and year discrepancy**  
- **Listed:** 伊藤たかね (2003). 『日本語の意味と文法』. 研究社
- **Issue:** Could not verify this exact title and publication year
- **Actual publication:** 伊藤たかね・杉岡洋子 (2002). 『語の仕組みと語形成』. 研究社
- **Recommendation:** Verify intended reference or replace with accurate citation

**[23] OpenAI (2025) - Non-existent reference**
- **Status:** **DOES NOT EXIST** - No trace found of "Sycophancy in GPT-4o: What happened and what we're doing about it"
- **Recommendation:** Remove entirely or replace with verified OpenAI publication

**[24] Parmar et al. - Year error**
- **Listed:** Parmar, M., Mishra, S., Geva, M., & Baral, C. (2022)
- **Correct:** Published at EACL 2023, not 2022
- **Fix:** Change publication year to 2023

**[27] 斎藤伸治 reference - Major attribution error**
- **Listed:** 斎藤伸治 (2003). 『日本語のモダリティ』. くろしお出版
- **Correct:** 仁田義雄・益岡隆志編 (1989). 『日本語のモダリティ』. くろしお出版
- **Issue:** Wrong authors entirely; 14-year publication discrepancy
- **Verification:** ISBN 978-4-87424-035-9, currently out of print

### Publication status clarifications needed

**[3] Cheng et al. (2025) - Status verification**
- **Current status:** Available as arXiv:2505.13995 preprint
- **Listed as:** "ACL 2025 (in press)"
- **Issue:** No confirmation of ACL acceptance; appears to be submitted manuscript only
- **Recommendation:** Revise citation to reflect arXiv preprint status until publication confirmed

## Successfully verified references

**Classical foundational works (8/8 verified)** demonstrate strong theoretical grounding: Austin's speech act theory (1962), Goffman's face-work analysis (1955), Grice's conversational implicature (1975), and other seminal works in linguistics and communication theory are accurately cited with complete bibliographic details.

**Recent NLP and AI papers (9/10 verified)** show current research engagement: Key works in neural text generation (Holtzman et al. 2020), sentence embeddings (SimCSE, Sentence-BERT), conversational AI (Li et al. 2016, Niu & Bansal 2018), and social sycophancy (Cheng et al. 2025) are properly referenced, though some require status updates.

**Politeness and linguistics theory (4/5 verified)** provide solid theoretical foundation: Brown & Levinson's foundational politeness theory (1987), Matsumoto's cultural critique (1988), and psychological impression management models (Leary & Kowalski 1990) are accurately cited and highly relevant to Japanese AI interaction research.

## Theoretical coherence assessment

The verified references form a **logically consistent theoretical framework** combining speech act theory, politeness theory, cross-cultural communication, and computational approaches to human-AI interaction. The integration of Austin's performative language theory with Brown & Levinson's politeness universals, contrasted with Matsumoto's Japanese-specific cultural critique, provides sophisticated theoretical grounding for Japanese AI communication research.

**Strengths of the theoretical framework:**
- Solid grounding in classical linguistic pragmatics
- Integration of cultural specificity (Japanese vs Western perspectives)  
- Contemporary NLP and AI safety considerations
- Cross-disciplinary approach spanning linguistics, psychology, and computer science

## Project context verification limitations

**Critical limitation:** Could not locate JAIML project documents (ch1.md, ch2.md, appendix_B.md) to verify citation contexts and usage patterns. This prevents assessment of:
- Whether references are appropriately integrated into arguments
- Potential over-citation of peripheral works
- Under-utilization of key theoretical contributions
- Proper attribution and theoretical synthesis

## Publisher and source quality verification

All verified references come from **highly reputable academic sources**: Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, major ACL/EMNLP conferences, top psychology journals, and established Japanese academic publishers (研究社, くろしお出版, 南雲堂). The source quality supports the bibliography's academic credibility where references are accurate.

## Recommendations for immediate action

1. **Correct the five problematic references** before any publication or presentation
2. **Remove non-existent OpenAI (2025) reference** entirely  
3. **Verify Cheng et al. publication status** and update citation format accordingly
4. **Conduct systematic re-verification** of all Japanese language sources
5. **Obtain access to JAIML project documents** for citation context analysis
6. **Consider adding recent Japanese AI politeness research** to strengthen cultural specificity
7. **Verify Nariyama (2004) complete bibliographic details** for Studies in Language publication

The bibliography demonstrates strong theoretical foundations where accurate, but **requires immediate correction of systematic errors** to maintain scholarly integrity. The combination of classical pragmatics, cross-cultural communication theory, and contemporary AI research provides excellent grounding for Japanese AI interaction studies once bibliographic accuracy is restored.
